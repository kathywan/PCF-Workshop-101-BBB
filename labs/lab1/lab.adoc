= Lab 1 - From Zero to Pushing Your First Application

== Target

. If you haven't already, download the latest release of the Cloud Foundry CLI from https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases for your operating system and install it.

. Set the API target for the CLI: (set appropriate end point for your environment)
+
----
$ cf api https://api.run.haas-123.pez.pivotal.io --skip-ssl-validation
----

. Login to Pivotal Cloudfoundry:
+
----
$ cf login
----
+
Follow the prompts

== Push It!

. Change to the _cf-spring-mvc-boot_ sample application directory:
+
----
$ cd $BOOTCAMP_HOME/cf-spring-mvc-boot
----

. Push the application!
+
----
$ cf push

<1> The CLI is using a manifest to provide necessary configuration details such as application name, memory to be allocated, and path to the application artifact.
Take a look at `manifest.yml` to see how.
<2> In most cases, the CLI indicates each Cloud Foundry API call as it happens.
In this case, the CLI has created an application record for _Workshop_ in your assigned space.
<3> All HTTP/HTTPS requests to applications will flow through Cloud Foundry's front-end router called http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/router.html[(Go)Router].
Here the CLI is creating a route with random word tokens inserted (again, see `manifest.yml` for a hint!) to prevent route collisions across the default domain.
<4> Now the CLI is _binding_ the created route to the application.
Routes can actually be bound to multiple applications to support techniques such as https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/blue-green.html[blue-green deployments].
<5> The CLI finally uploads the application bits to Pivotal Cloudfoundry.
<6> Now we begin the staging process. The https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack[Java Buildpack] is detected and responsible for assembling the runtime components necessary to run the application.
<7> Here we see the version of the JRE that has been chosen and installed.
<8> The complete package of your application and all of its necessary runtime components is called a _droplet_.
Here the droplet is being uploaded to Pivotal Cloudfoundry's internal blobstore so that it can be easily downloaded to one or more Diego cells for execution.
<9> The CLI tells you exactly what command and argument set was used to start your application.
<10> Finally the CLI reports the current status of your application's health.

== Interact with App from CF CLI

. Get information about the currently deployed application using CLI apps command:
+
----
$ cf apps
----
+
Note the application name for next steps

. Get information about running instances, memory, CPU, and other statistics using CLI instances command
+
----
$ cf app <<app_name>>
----

. Get environment variables
+
----
$ cf env <<app_name>>
----

. Stop the deployed application using the CLI
+
----
$ cf stop <<app_name>>
----
