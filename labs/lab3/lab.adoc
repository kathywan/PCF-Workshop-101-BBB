= Lab 3 - Operating your Application

[abstract]
--
Pivotal Cloudfoundry makes the work of performing operations actions, such as scaling, doing a zero-downtime deploy, and managing application health very easy.
In the next two labs we'll explore Pivotal Cloudfoundry operations.
--

== Scale the Application Up
. Follow the steps here to CF Push a simple lightweight link:../lab1/lab-ruby.adoc[**Ruby** Application]
+
. Now let's increase the number of running application instances to 3:
+
----
$ cf scale scale-demo -i 3
Scaling app scale-demo in org student20-org / space development as student20...
OK
----
+
In reporting `OK`, the CLI is letting you know that the additional requested instances have been started, but they are not yet necessarily running.

. We can determine how many instances are actually running like this:
+
====
----
$ cf app scale-demo
Showing health and status for app scale-demo in org student20-org / space development as student20...

name:              scale-demo
requested state:   started
instances:         3/3
usage:             128M x 3 instances
routes:            scale-demo-wacky-chipmunk.cfapps.haas-123.pez.pivotal.io

     state     since                  cpu    memory          disk          details

#2   starting   2018-10-08T22:25:19Z   0.0%   19.5M of 128M   94.3M of 1G    <2>
----
<1> This application instance has completed the startup process and is actually able to accept requests.
<2> This application instance is still starting and will not have any requests routed to it.
====

. Eventually all instances will converge to a running state:
+
----
$ cf app scale-demo
Showing health and status for app scale-demo in org student20-org / space development as student20...

name:              scale-demo
requested state:   started
instances:         2/2
usage:             128M x 2 instances
routes:            scale-demo-wacky-chipmunk.cfapps.haas-123.pez.pivotal.io
last uploaded:     Mon 08 Oct 10:35:30 EDT 2018
stack:             cflinuxfs2
buildpack:         ruby

     state     since                  cpu    memory          disk          details
#0   running   2018-10-08T14:36:09Z   0.0%   24.5M of 128M   94.3M of 1G
#1   running   2018-10-08T22:25:19Z   0.0%   19.5M of 128M   94.3M of 1G
----

. Revisit the application route in the browser.
Refresh several times.
You should observe the instance index changing as you do so:
+
image::lab.png[]
+
The aforementioned http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/router.html[(Go)Router] is applying a round-robin routing algorithm to all of the application instances assigned to this route.
As an instance reaches the `running` state, it'll be registed to the routing table assigned to its route by sending a message to Cloud Foundry's message bus.
All (Go)Router instances are subscribed to this channel and register the routes independently.
This makes for very dynamic and rapid reconfiguration!

== Scale the Application Down

. We can scale the application instances back down as easily as we scaled them up, using the same command structure:
+
----
$ cf scale scale-demo -i 1
Scaling app scale-demo in org student20-org / space development as student20...
OK
----

. Check the application status again:
+
----
$ cf app scale-demo
Showing health and status for app scale-demo in org student20-org / space development as student20...

name:              scale-demo
requested state:   started
instances:         1/1
usage:             128M x 1 instances
routes:            scale-demo-wacky-chipmunk.cfapps.haas-123.pez.pivotal.io
last uploaded:     Mon 08 Oct 10:35:30 EDT 2018
stack:             cflinuxfs2
buildpack:         ruby

     state     since                  cpu    memory          disk          details
#0   running   2018-10-08T14:36:09Z   0.0%   25.3M of 128M   94.3M of 1G
----
+
As you can see, we're back down to only one instance running, and it is in fact the original index 0 that we started with.

. Confirm that by again revisiting the route in the browser and checking the instance index:

== HTTP Routing

There are two ways to discover what routes, or HTTP URLs, are mapped to an application
The first is available via the CLI. Just type:

----
$ cf app workshop
Showing health and status for app workshop in org pivot-ksrinivasarao / space development as ksrinivasarao@pivotal.io...

name:                workshop
requested state:     started
instances:           1/1
isolation segment:   main
usage:               768M x 1 instances
routes:              workshop-anxious-fox.pcfbeta.io
last uploaded:       Mon 09 Jul 10:26:35 EDT 2018
stack:               cflinuxfs2
buildpack:           client-certificate-mapper=1.6.0_RELEASE container-security-provider=1.13.0_RELEASE
                     java-buildpack=v4.12-offline-https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack.git#5dca820 java-main java-opts
                     java-security jvmkill-agent=1.12.0_RELEASE open-jdk-...

     state     since                  cpu    memory           disk           details
#0   running   2018-07-09T15:49:00Z   0.5%   284.3M of 768M   154.3M of 1G
----

and you'll see the list of routes in the section that says _routes_.

The second way is via the Apps Manager UI.  Click on the _Workshop_ application to view application details.  Select the _Routes_ tab to view a list of mapped routes:

image::lab2.png[]

. We can easily add an additional route by clicking on _MAP A ROUTE_ and supplying the new hostname.  Make sure to use a unique name that won't conflict with other workshop participants:
+
image::lab3.png[]

. Navigate to the new URL in your browser window.  You should see that same application displayed!
+
image::lab4.png[]

. We can just as easily remove a route by clicking on _Unmap (X icon)_ on the route you wish to remove.
+
image::lab5.png[]
+
If you navigate to that URL you'll receive a HTTP 404 response
+

. This is how blue-green deployments are accomplished.

== Accessing Container Contents

SSH into your app container via 'cf ssh APP_NAME'
----
$ cf ssh workshop
vcap@18de6089-644b-41ae-56e1-101f:~$ ls
